"""Response models for the record-list read contract.

These two live here rather than in a service's ``models/`` package because both
tiers need them and neither owns them: the reader returns them from
``GET /api/v1/dataexplorer/entities`` (as ``response_model``, so the shape is enforced by
FastAPI), and the curator's record list is generated from the same schema. A
copy per service would let the two drift silently — the frontend talks to both.

The write-path models (``EntityData``, ``DataCreateResponse``,
``ValidationResult``, ``TripleObject``) stay in the curator: they describe
mutations, which only that service performs.
