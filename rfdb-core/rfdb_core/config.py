"""Settings shared by every RossijskijFeatrDB service.

Holds only what more than one service needs: how to reach the triplestore, where
the SHACL schema lives, CORS, logging, and the object-storage credentials. Each
service subclasses :class:`BaseServiceSettings` and adds its own fields — the
curator its seeding/reset/read-only knobs, the reader its content-negotiation
options — then instantiates a module-level ``settings`` singleton of its own.

Values come exclusively from environment variables or a ``.env`` file; no
deployment-specific defaults are hardcoded. Fields with no default here are
**required** and raise a ``ValidationError`` at startup naming the missing
variable. The ``.env`` path is resolved relative to the working directory, which
is each service's own root.
