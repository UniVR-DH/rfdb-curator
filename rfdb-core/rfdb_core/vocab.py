"""RDF vocabulary the digital-copy machinery owns.

The anchor shape plus the schema.org terms written for each file node. How a node
links to a parent (predicate + parent class) is resolved from the SHACL schema at
runtime — never hardcoded.

Split out of ``models/files.py`` because these are plain vocabulary constants, not
response models, and three separate layers need them: ``schema_extractor`` (which
lives here in rfdb-core), the curator's write path, and the reader's download and
file-stats routes. Keeping them in a service's ``models/`` package would have made
this shared library import from that service.
