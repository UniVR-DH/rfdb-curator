"""Read-side view of digital-copy state: RDF vs. object storage.

Everything here is read-only, and it is needed on both sides of the writer/reader
split, which is why it lives in the shared library:

  * the reader's ``GET /api/v1/dataexplorer/meta/files`` renders these counts in the Data
    Context Panel;
  * the curator's ``scripts/cleanup_files.py`` reconciler acts on them;
  * the reader's download route asks :func:`is_file_referenced` whether a file
    is a published resource at all, and the curator's staging response hands
    back :func:`staged_content_url`.

The second consumer is the reason this cannot live in the read service: the
cleanup script is a curator-side maintenance tool, so putting the snapshot in
``dataexplorer-backend`` would make the writer depend on the reader.

RDF is the source of truth throughout — storage is compared against it, never
the other way around. That direction is load-bearing for the download route:
which prefix holds a file's bytes is a storage detail that can lag RDF, so it
must never be used to decide whether the file is published.

    Built from ``RFDB_BASE`` — the same constant that mints the entity's own IRI

    ``https://rosfeatr.eu/rdf/data/File_x/content``.

    Absolute on purpose, which **reverses** this function's earlier reasoning
    that a persisted value "must not bake in a host" (decision D9). That was
    right while the value was an application path and the host was a deployment
    detail; it is wrong for a published identifier, where the host is part of the
    identity. The payoff: an exported graph is self-contained and correct with no
    base-URL side channel, and the URL resolves by being visited.

    Note for clients: this is the **identifier**. Any deployment whose reader is
    not on ``RFDB_BASE``'s host — every dev stack — must re-base the path onto
    its own read origin instead of fetching this URL as-is.

    Separate from :func:`file_content_url` because the two live on different

    by the writer that accepted them, while a registered file is a published
    resource served by the reader. Keeping them apart is what lets the reader
    refuse unsubmitted content outright.

    Only ever returned in the staging response — never persisted. The submit
    path re-derives ``schema:contentUrl`` with :func:`file_content_url`, so what
    lands in RDF is always the published path.

    Still **relative**, deliberately, now that :func:`file_content_url` is
    absolute: a staged file is not a published resource and has no identity to
    publish — it is one curator's working state on one service. That contrast is
    now load-bearing on the client, which picks a base by whether the value is

    This is the "is it a published resource?" test, and RDF answers it. A file's

    happen to sit, and that lags behind RDF whenever a promotion fails — which
    the write path tolerates by design, logging a warning and leaving the object

    promotion indistinguishable from a file that was never submitted.
