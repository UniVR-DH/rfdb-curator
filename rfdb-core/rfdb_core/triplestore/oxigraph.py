"""Oxigraph implementation of the :class:`~rfdb_core.triplestore.base.TripleStore` seam.

All communication uses the Oxigraph HTTP API:
  - /query  — SPARQL SELECT and CONSTRUCT (read)
  - /update — SPARQL UPDATE (write)
  - /store  — Graph Store Protocol (bulk load)
  - /update — SPARQL UPDATE for store management (DROP ALL, CLEAR DEFAULT)

Oxigraph is intentionally schema-free; all shape constraints are enforced
by ``ShaclValidator`` in Python before any data reaches this layer.

    The first (and currently only) implementation of :class:`TripleStore`. Built via
    :func:`rfdb_core.triplestore.build_triplestore` at startup and stored on
    ``app.state.store``; all API routes pull it from there.

    Reads use only SPARQL 1.1, so a store-agnostic reader can point at any compliant
    endpoint. The writes (``update``, ``load_turtle``, ``clear_store``) additionally
    rely on the Graph Store Protocol.

    Named-graph scoping: when ``data_graph_uri`` is set (the default), every
    SELECT and CONSTRUCT query is automatically wrapped with a ``FROM <uri>``
    clause so reads are always scoped to the configured graph.  Turtle loads
    use ``?graph=<uri>`` via the Graph Store Protocol rather than ``?default``.
    This makes the named graph totally transparent to route handlers.
