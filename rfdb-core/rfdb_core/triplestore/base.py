"""The ``TripleStore`` seam — what both backends may assume of a triplestore.

Mirrors the ``file_storage`` seam that already isolates Garage: routes and seeders
talk to this interface, never to a store's HTTP API, so another store (Fuseki/Jena,
GraphDB, Qlever, RDF4J, an embedded library, …) can be dropped in via the
``TRIPLESTORE`` setting.

Two things to know about the shape of this Protocol:

**The names are today's names, deliberately.** Every signature here is transcribed
from the pre-existing Oxigraph client rather than redesigned — see decision D6 in
the refactor plan. Renaming ``query`` → ``query_select`` and ``construct`` →
``query_construct`` would have touched ~20 call sites and the ~12 test modules that
hand-roll fake clients, for no behavioural gain, and would have made a
behaviour-neutral extraction unreviewable. A naming review is queued in ``TODO.md``
for when a second implementation actually exists to test the names against.

**The graph-scoping members are part of the contract, not an implementation
detail.** Route handlers build SPARQL strings *around* :meth:`from_clause` and
:meth:`with_clause`, and ``validation_merge._build_validation_construct`` takes a
``from_clause`` string as a parameter. A store whose scoping model differs must
still return usable clause strings (or empty ones, which callers already handle —
``/api/v1/dataexplorer/meta/graphs`` deliberately queries unscoped).

Read methods are used by both services; the write methods are the curator's alone,
which is what lets a reader be pointed at a read-only SPARQL endpoint.
