"""IRI validation for anything that gets interpolated into SPARQL text.

Both services take full IRIs straight from the client — path parameters, query
strings, JSON-LD ``@id`` values, predicate URIs from an update payload — and
splice them into query strings inside ``<…>``. Any character that could close
that bracket or start a new clause has to be rejected before the splice. This
module is that check, in one place; it was previously duplicated verbatim in
the curator's ``api/data.py`` and the reader's ``api/graph.py``.

Returns a reason string rather than raising an HTTP error: rfdb-core is
framework-agnostic, and choosing a status code is the service's job. Callers
keep a three-line adapter next to their other handlers::

    def _validate_iri(iri: str) -> None:
        if reason := iri_error(iri):
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=reason)

This is deliberately a syntactic guard, not IRI parsing (RFC 3987). It is the
last line of defence for query construction, so it errs toward refusing input
that merely *looks* dangerous.
