"""The writer's route surface, pinned as a specification (decision D8).

The reader has the same guard in ``tests/dataexplorer/test_app_contract.py``. Two
route-set assertions, one per service, are what make the URL partition enforceable
rather than aspirational: a route added to the wrong service, or a namespace that
drifts back toward the old unowned ``/api/…``, fails here instead of surfacing as a
405 in someone's browser.

Why this matters more than it looks: every symptom that produced this refactor's
corrections (C17–C20) was a URL that identified an operation on a host rather than a
resource. The partition is the fix, so it needs a test.
