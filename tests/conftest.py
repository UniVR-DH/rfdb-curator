"""Root pytest bootstrap: the environment every service's settings need.

Only the variables in ``rfdb_core.config.BaseServiceSettings`` — the ones both
backends read — are set here. The curator's writer-only variables (seeding,
reset, write-permission switches) live in ``tests/curator/conftest.py``, because
a read-service test has no use for them and setting them here would blur which
service owns what.

``tests/core/`` needs nothing beyond these: its subjects are the schema and the
triplestore seam.

This keeps test collection independent from external CI environment wiring.
