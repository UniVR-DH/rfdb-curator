"""What the read service must and must not be.

These are structural assertions rather than behavioural ones, and they exist
because the writer/reader split is the kind of boundary that erodes silently: a
convenient import, a route added to the wrong app, one more thing on
``app.state``. Each check below turns one of those into a test failure.

Covers the acceptance criteria for Task 5 of the modular-services refactor:
exactly three ``app.state`` entries, no write route, no validator, ``/shapes``
unstamped (decision D3), and ``/health`` without a ``seed`` key.
