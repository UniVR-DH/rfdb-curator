"""The published-resource test for digital copies: ``is_file_referenced``.

Covered here rather than only through the reader's download route because this
predicate is what decides whether a file is public at all, and two of its
properties are invisible from that route: the malformed-id guard (the route
validates before calling, so the guard is unreachable from there) and the
schema-driven choice of link predicates.

The link predicates come from the schema, never a hardcoded list, so these tests
use the real ``schema.ttl`` — a schema change that stopped linking digital copies
should fail here rather than silently make every file unpublished.
