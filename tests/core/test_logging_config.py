"""``configure_logging`` must be safe to call more than once.

It is called more than once in practice: ``uvicorn --reload`` re-imports the
module on every source change, and the test suites reconfigure per imported app.
The original implementation handled the duplicate-handler half of that
(``root.handlers.clear()``) but not the resource half — clearing the list drops
the reference to an already-open ``RotatingFileHandler`` without closing it, so
each reconfiguration leaked one file descriptor.

Nothing caught it, for a reason worth keeping in mind: Python ignores
``ResourceWarning`` by default, so a leak of exactly this shape is invisible to a
green suite. It surfaced only when the warning filters were turned off while
chasing Task 10's "zero warnings" acceptance criterion.
