"""The ``readOnly`` stamp is single-sourced — decision D11's required guard.

Both services serve a shape catalogue, and the two payloads must be identical. The
catalogue itself was always shared (one ``SchemaExtractor``, one ``schema.ttl``);
the *flag* was not, and that single divergence produced C20 — the editor could only
get the flags from the writer, so it rendered an empty sidebar whenever the writer
was down.

The invariant is maintained by sharing the implementation, not by two copies that
agree today. So this module tests the shared function's behaviour, and then asserts
that neither service builds the key itself. That second half is the part a route
test cannot cover: a re-implementation would pass every endpoint test right up until
the day the two drifted.
