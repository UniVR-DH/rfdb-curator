"""One version per package, across every file that names one.

The same pin is written down in four places, and each is read by a different
consumer:

* ``<service>/pyproject.toml`` — what ``uv`` resolves into the root ``uv.lock``,
  and therefore what the test suite and every local check actually import.
* ``<service>/requirements.txt`` — what ``pip install`` puts in the **Docker
  image**. The Dockerfiles do not use ``uv.lock`` at all.
* ``rfdb-core/pyproject.toml`` — the shared library's own pins, deliberately
  mirroring the services' for the five packages it uses.
* the root ``requirements.txt`` — documentation, installed by nothing.

The consequence of a divergence is asymmetric and quiet: the suite passes on one
set of versions while every container runs another, so the bump is *verified*
against software that is not *deployed*. Task 10 found exactly that — the plan's
own file list named the two ``pyproject.toml`` files and ``uv.lock``, and missed
both ``requirements.txt``, which would have shipped a refresh that reached no
container.

The files already carried a comment saying they were kept in lockstep. A comment
is a request to remember; this is the check. Same reasoning as
``test_compose_topology.py``: repo-topology assertions belong wherever CI already
runs the repo-wide checks, and they must hold with no Docker daemon and no
network.

**Deliberately not checked here:** that ``rfdb-core``'s pins mirror the services'
for the packages they share. uv already enforces it, and harder than a test could
— a one-sided bump makes the workspace unsatisfiable, so ``uv lock``, ``uv sync``
and even ``uv run`` refuse with *"Because rfdb-core depends on pydantic==2.12.5
and rfdb-curator-backend depends on pydantic==2.13.4…"*. That was verified, not
assumed. A test asserting it would restate the resolver rather than cover a gap,
which is the distinction that earns a test its place: the four ``requirements.txt``
checks below hold because **nothing** reads those files during resolution.
