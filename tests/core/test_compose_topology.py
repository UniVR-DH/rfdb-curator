"""The deploy-mode invariant, as a test instead of a note to remember.

Task 9 makes which kind of instance this is a deploy-time choice: base services
carry no ``profiles:`` key and run in every mode, while ``curator-backend`` and
``curator-frontend`` are ``full``-only. The plan attached a warning to that —
*"re-check after any compose edit"* — because Compose versions **disagree** about
what a ``depends_on`` pointing into an inactive profile does: some silently
activate that profile (so read mode quietly starts the editor), some hard-error
(so read mode will not start at all). Either way the failure appears at deploy
time, on someone else's machine, from an edit that looked local.

An instruction to re-check is the weakest form of an invariant, so it is checked
here. These tests read the compose files directly rather than shelling out to
``docker compose config`` — the assertions are about what the files declare, and
they should hold on a machine with no Docker daemon. ``docker compose config``
validation is a separate CI step, which catches the different class of problem
(bad interpolation, unknown keys).

Repo topology rather than library behaviour, so it sits in ``tests/core`` only
because that is the suite CI already runs the repo-wide checks alongside.
