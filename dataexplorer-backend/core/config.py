"""Settings for the read service.

There is no subclass here, and that is the finding rather than an omission: every
field this service reads — store connection, schema path, CORS, logging, S3, and
``READ_ONLY_SHAPES`` — already lives in
``rfdb_core.config.BaseServiceSettings``. What curator-backend adds on top of that
base is *exactly* the write-side surface (``VOCAB_PATH``, ``DATA_PATH``,
``RESET_DATA_ON_STARTUP``, ``SEED_*``, ``READ_ONLY``, ``MAX_UPLOAD_MB``), and a
reader has no use for any of it.

``READ_ONLY_SHAPES`` is in the shared base rather than that list on purpose (D11):
it reads like a write concern, but it states which shapes are *editable*, which
this service needs in order to serve the same shape catalogue the curator does.
Withholding it is what forced the editor to fetch its shape list from the writer,
and therefore to show nothing when the writer was down (C20).

``extra="ignore"`` on the base config means a shared ``.env`` carrying those
writer variables is harmless here — this service simply does not see them. The
flip side is worth knowing: setting ``READ_ONLY=true`` has no effect on this
process, because there is nothing to switch off.
