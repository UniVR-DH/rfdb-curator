"""FastAPI application entrypoint for the RossijskijFeatrDB read backend.

This service answers queries and never mutates the store. What that buys is
mostly negative, and the absences are the design:

  * **No SHACL validator.** Validation exists to gate writes.
  * **No seeder, no reset.** It never loads or clears anything; the store arrives
    populated (by curator-backend's startup, or by
    ``curator-backend/scripts/seed.py`` run as a one-shot job).
  * **No shape dependency graph.** That plans the CONSTRUCT for merge-on-write.
  * **No ``READ_ONLY`` switch.** There is nothing to switch off.

Startup sequence (lifespan context manager):
  1. Parse ``schema/schema.ttl`` into a ``SchemaExtractor``.
  2. Build a ``TripleStore`` via ``build_triplestore(settings)`` (Oxigraph today).
  3. Build the object-storage client for digital-copy downloads.

Exactly three objects land on ``app.state`` — ``schema_extractor``, ``store``,
``storage`` — which is what the requirement matrix in the modular-services plan
measured across the six read routers. Anything a handler needs beyond those three
is a sign it belongs in the writer.

Note — no readiness poll here, unlike curator-backend:
    The writer polls ``health()`` at startup because it is about to clear and
    seed, and a refused connection mid-wipe is unrecoverable. This service only
    reads, so an unreachable store is a *per-request* condition: handlers return
    503 (or empty results), ``/health`` reports ``store: "down"``, and the
    service recovers on its own once Oxigraph answers. Blocking startup on the
    store would make the reader less available, not more correct.
