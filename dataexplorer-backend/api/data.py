"""Data read routes: list entities by shape, count them, fetch one by IRI.

The read half of what used to be one ``api/data.py``. The handler bodies are
carried over unchanged — same SPARQL, same response shapes, same status codes —
because the frontend's contract must not move when the route does. The write half
(``POST /data``, ``DELETE /data/{id}``, digital-copy reconciliation, SHACL merge
planning) stayed in curator-backend along with everything it needs.

The only helper these three ever needed from the shared pool is the IRI guard,
which now lives in ``rfdb_core.iri``.

    The IRI travels as ``?id=``, matching ``/graph/node``, and **never** as a path
    segment. Two reasons, both learned the hard way:

    1. **No route may shadow a sibling.** A path parameter here would have to be
       ``{iri:path}`` — greedy, because an encoded IRI's ``%2F`` is decoded before
       matching — and a greedy parameter directly under ``/entities/`` silently
       swallows ``/entities/search`` and ``/entities/counts`` unless every literal
       route happens to be registered first. That invariant is invisible at the call
       site and was spread across three files.
    2. **No double-encoding trap.** A path-encoded IRI has to be encoded twice to
       survive, and a bare local name fails the unsafe-IRI guard with a 400 that
       looks like a data problem.

    ``get`` is a verb in a URL, which is deliberate: this is the *operational*
    surface, where the HTTP method is not enough to disambiguate a lookup from a
    collection. The resource-oriented address for the same entity already exists as
    ``GET /rdf/data/{local_name}``, which is where RESTful identity belongs.

    Issues a SPARQL CONSTRUCT scoped to the configured named graph and returns
    every ``(predicate, object)`` pair as a JSON array.  Literal objects carry
    ``datatype`` and ``language`` metadata so the frontend form can reconstruct
    the original RDF values faithfully.

        entity_id: Full IRI of the entity (URL-path-encoded by FastAPI).
