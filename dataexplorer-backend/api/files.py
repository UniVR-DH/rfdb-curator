"""Digital-copy download: stream a *published* PDF back to the client.

Mounted as ``GET /rdf/data/{file_id}/content`` — inside the stable data space, not
under ``/api``, because the bytes are a **representation of the resource** whose
IRI is ``/rdf/data/{file_id}`` (D8). This is the URL that ``schema:contentUrl``
points at, so it is a persisted identifier and must never move again.

The read half of the upload-first digital-copy flow. Staging (``POST
/files/staged``), the server-side metadata re-derivation and the promotion to
``registered/`` all stayed in curator-backend — this service only ever hands
bytes out.

Two questions get answered here, and keeping them apart is the whole design:

1. **Is this a published resource?** An RDF question, answered by
   ``is_file_referenced``. Bytes with no parent entity pointing at them are one
   curator's unsubmitted working state, not something this public service
   publishes, so they are refused. Curators preview their own staged uploads
   through the writer's ``GET /api/v1/curator/files/staged/{file_id}`` instead —
   an application route, not a published identifier, which is why it stays in the
   ``/api`` space while this one does not.
2. **Where do the bytes live?** A storage detail. ``registered/`` is tried
   first, then ``staged/``, because a promotion can fail *after* the entity
   write succeeds (the write path logs a warning and leaves the object for
   ``scripts/cleanup_files.py``). Such a file is published and must download —
   but it is also a fault, so it is served with
   ``X-RFDB-File-State: awaiting-promotion`` and a warning rather than silently,
   which is how a stalled reconciler used to stay invisible.

Deciding (1) on the storage prefix instead of on RDF is what made those two
states indistinguishable: a legitimately-staged file and one whose promotion had
broken both answered plain ``200``.

Downloads are proxied through the backend (never a direct browser→Garage path)
so Garage can stay on the internal network in production.

Note what is *absent*: ``_assert_writable_mode``. The curator's ``api/files.py``
imports that from ``api.data`` to guard its routes. Nothing here mutates, so
there is no mode to assert — and no import back into the write service.
