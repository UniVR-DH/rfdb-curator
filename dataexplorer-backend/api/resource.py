"""Content-negotiated dereference — the Linked Data surface of the ``/rdf/`` space.

This is what makes RFDB's persisted IRIs *cool*: an entity's IRI is
``https://rosfeatr.eu/rdf/data/{local_name}``, production serves that host, so
visiting the identifier returns the resource (D9). No ``?iri=`` parameter, which an
earlier sketch of this endpoint had — once the IRI *is* the URL, there is nothing
to pass.

Two things follow from being a data space rather than an application surface (D8):

  * **Unversioned.** Versioning an identifier that is persisted inside triples is a
    contradiction; the ``/api/v1/…`` routes carry the version instead.
  * **Local names, not encoded IRIs.** The path segment is the local name, and the
    full IRI is rebuilt from ``RFDB_BASE``. The editor-facing
    ``/api/v1/dataexplorer/entities/get?id=`` still takes a URL-encoded absolute
    IRI because it answers a different question (an editor's bespoke triple list,
    not a representation), but a client that has an RFDB IRI in hand never needs
    to encode anything here.

Five representations, none of them costing a dependency: four are rdflib
serializations, and the HTML one is an f-string. Deliberately *not* a template
engine — ``jinja2`` does not resolve transitively here (Starlette's
``Jinja2Templates`` is an optional extra), so one page would have meant adding a
dependency, and this page has no sibling to share a layout with.

So a browser gets HTML on ``/rdf/data/{id}``. ``/rdf/schema/{name}`` stays
RDF-only: a shape's description is mostly blank nodes — a shape *is* its property
descriptors — which a flat subject-centric page would silently drop, and the shape
catalogue already has a rendered form in the editor, fed by
``/api/v1/dataexplorer/shapes``. An ``Accept`` we cannot satisfy at all still
falls back to Turtle rather than 406ing: answering in some representation beats
making a persisted identifier look broken.
