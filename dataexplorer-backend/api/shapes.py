"""Shape metadata for read clients: the sidebar nav and the graph type picker.

**Identical to the curator's shapes response** (decision D11). Both services build
it with :func:`rfdb_core.shapes.list_shapes` over the same ``schema.ttl``, so there
is one implementation and one place to change.

This reverses D3, which had the reader omit the ``readOnly`` flag on the grounds
that ``READ_ONLY_SHAPES`` was a write-policy setting a read service had no business
knowing. The flag does gate writes — but it also states which shapes are editable,
which is exactly what a client needs to render a UI. Withholding it meant the
editor had to fetch its shape list from the writer, so with the writer down it had
no sidebar at all (C20). Serving the same catalogue from both services removes the
divergence instead of teaching the client to work around it.

There is still no forms route here: form field definitions exist to drive an
editing form.
