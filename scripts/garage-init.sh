#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/garage-init.sh — Garage bootstrap for DEV or PROD (runs on the HOST).
#
# WHEN TO RUN
#   Once, after the FIRST `docker compose up` on a fresh Garage volume:
#     • the very first time you bring a stack up, or
#     • any time after `docker compose down -v` (that destroys garage_data +
#       garage_meta, so the cluster is empty again).
#   Idempotent — safe to re-run; every step is a no-op if already done.
#
#   You do NOT run it on ordinary `up`/`down` (without -v): the named volumes
#   survive, so the layout, bucket, and key are still there.
#
# DEV (defaults — docker-compose.yml + .env):
#   scripts/garage-init.sh
#
# PROD (point it at the other compose file and env file):
#   COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml ENV_FILE=.env.prod scripts/garage-init.sh
#
#   Parametrized rather than forked: the four steps (layout → bucket → key
#   import → grant) are identical in both environments, and two copies of this
#   logic would drift exactly where a mistake is least recoverable — a wrong
#   layout version cannot be re-applied.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#   Garage keeps its cluster layout, buckets, and access keys in its metadata
#   DB — none of them can be declared in garage.toml. A fresh volume therefore
#   needs these four steps run once. The Garage image is distroless (no shell,
#   no coreutils — only the /garage binary), so this script runs on the host
#   and drives the CLI through `docker compose exec`.
#
# PREREQUISITES
#   • A `garage` service defined in docker-compose.yml and currently up.
#   • S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID / S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (and optionally S3_BUCKET) set in
#     the repo-root .env — the SAME predefined creds the backend reads, so
#     there is no generated secret to copy back.
