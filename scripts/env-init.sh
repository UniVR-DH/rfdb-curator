#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/env-init.sh — generate the DEV .env on first setup (runs on the HOST).
#
# WHEN TO RUN
#   Once, on a fresh checkout before the first `docker compose up`. It writes
#   the repo-root .env with freshly generated dev secrets.
#   Idempotent-ish: it REFUSES to clobber an existing .env unless you pass
#   --force (dev data is disposable, but an accidental regenerate would
#   invalidate the Garage key already imported into the cluster metadata).
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#   .env is gitignored (it holds secrets), so a fresh checkout has none. The
#   dev stack needs the Garage RPC secret and the predefined S3 creds shared by
#   Garage (key import) and the backend. This mints them with openssl in the
#   exact format garage-init.sh and the backend expect.
#
# NEXT STEP
#   After this: `docker compose up -d`, then `scripts/garage-init.sh` once to
#   apply the layout, create the bucket, and import the key.
#
# PROD: do not use this file. See .env.prod.example + the prod bootstrap note.
