/**
 * Centralised API client used by all React components.
 *
 * Two backends, so two bases:
 *   - `BASE_URL` → curator-backend (:8000), the only service that writes.
 *   - `READ_BASE` → dataexplorer-backend (:8001), which answers every read.
 *
 * Routes are namespaced by owning service (D8): `/api/v1/curator/…` and
 * `/api/v1/dataexplorer/…`, plus the reader's unversioned `/rdf/…` data space for
 * anything with a persisted identifier. Pointing a call at the wrong base now
 * fails with a clean 404 rather than a 405 from a path that exists on both
 * services for different methods.
 *
 * Both bases are **relative in dev and in production**, deliberately: every
 * request goes to the origin that served the page, so nothing browser-facing
 * names a host and one config runs on localhost, on an IP, through an SSH
 * tunnel, or behind a domain. Routing lives where hostnames are stable — the
 * Vite dev server's proxy (vite.config.js) and proxy/Caddyfile in prod, which
 * split the identical prefixes.
 *
 * `READ_BASE` used to be absolute even in dev, working around `GET` and
 * `DELETE /api/data/{id}` being the same path on two services — which a
 * prefix-keyed proxy cannot split. D8 removed that collision; the workaround
 * outlived it, and every non-local deployment paid for it, because a remote dev
 * host would serve this bundle and the browser would then resolve its reads
 * against *its own* machine. A non-empty base is now only for a build whose
 * reader genuinely sits on another origin — which also needs a matching
 * CORS_ORIGINS entry on that reader.
 *
 * All methods return the unwrapped `data` field from the axios response so
 * callers work directly with the JSON payload.
