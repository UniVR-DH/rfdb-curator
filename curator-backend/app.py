"""FastAPI application entrypoint for the RossijskijFeatrDB data-entry backend.

Startup sequence (lifespan context manager):
  1. Parse ``schema/schema.ttl`` into a ``SchemaExtractor`` and a
     ``ShaclValidator`` (both read the same file; see note in lifespan).
  2. Build a ``TripleStore`` via ``build_triplestore(settings)`` (Oxigraph today).
  3. Optionally call ``TripleStore.clear_store()`` when ``reset_data_on_startup``
     is ``true`` — wipes all named graphs and the default graph before seeding.
     If this step fails the process aborts; the app must not start with a
     partially-cleared store.
  4. Call ``seed_store()`` to load ``vocab.ttl`` (and optionally ``data.ttl``) into
     Oxigraph.  When ``reset_data_on_startup`` is ``false`` this is idempotent;
     duplicate triples are silently merged by Oxigraph.

All three service objects are stored on ``app.state`` so every route handler
can access them via ``request.app.state.<name>`` without global imports.

Note — startup blocking I/O:
    All startup work (file parsing, HTTP calls to Oxigraph) is synchronous and
    runs on the event loop thread inside the lifespan context manager.  This is
    safe because no requests are served until after ``yield``.  If startup time
    becomes a concern, wrap each blocking call in ``asyncio.to_thread()``.

Note — Oxigraph readiness:
    The Oxigraph Docker healthcheck (``oxigraph --help``) only proves the
    process is alive, not that its HTTP port is accepting connections yet.
    Steps 3 and 4 are therefore delegated to ``core.seeder.bootstrap_store()``,
    which polls ``TripleStore.health()`` before any reset/seed call that would
    otherwise raise on a refused connection. ``scripts/seed.py`` calls the same
    function, so a one-shot seed job cannot skip the poll.

    """Initialise shared services before the server starts accepting requests.

    Follows the FastAPI lifespan protocol: everything before ``yield`` runs at
    startup; everything after ``yield`` runs at shutdown (nothing to tear down
    here because Oxigraph runs as a separate container).

    All work is synchronous and blocking — see the module-level note on startup
    blocking I/O for the rationale and a migration path if needed.

    Steps
    -----
    1. Build the in-memory SHACL index (``SchemaExtractor``) and validator
       (``ShaclValidator``).  Both parse ``settings.schema_path`` independently;
       this is a known redundancy that can be eliminated by passing a pre-parsed
       rdflib ``Graph`` to ``ShaclValidator`` once the interface supports it.
    2. Build the ``TripleStore`` and the object-storage client.
    3. Hand off to ``bootstrap_store()``, which polls the store until it
       responds, wipes it when ``reset_data_on_startup`` is ``True`` (any
       exception there propagates and aborts startup intentionally — the app
       must not serve requests against a partially-cleared store), and seeds
       vocab plus optional test data.
    4. Store the returned seed report on ``app.state`` for ``/health``.
