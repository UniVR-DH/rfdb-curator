"""Data seeder for the triple store — the curator's, and only the curator's.

Two entry points, one code path:

  * ``bootstrap_store()`` is called by the FastAPI lifespan on every startup;
  * ``scripts/seed.py`` calls the same function as a one-shot job, so a
    deployment can seed without starting a web server (see the read-only
    deploy mode in the modular-services plan).

Design notes:
  - `vocab.ttl` is idempotent: Oxigraph merges triples rather than replacing,
    so re-seeding on every restart is safe.
  - `data.ttl` is for development and testing only; it is never seeded in
    production unless explicitly enabled via `SEED_TEST_DATA_ON_STARTUP=true`.
