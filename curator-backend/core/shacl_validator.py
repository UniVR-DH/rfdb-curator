"""SHACL validation wrapper used by all write routes.

The validator is initialised once at startup with the project schema
(`schema/schema.ttl`) and reused for every POST /api/v1/curator/entities and
POST /api/v1/curator/validate request.  No data ever reaches Oxigraph without
passing through here first.

Important: when validating a newly created entity that references existing
store entities (e.g., a HoldingOrganization referencing a Place), the caller
is responsible for merging the referenced triples into the graph passed to
`validate()`.  See `core.validation_merge` for the merge strategy.
