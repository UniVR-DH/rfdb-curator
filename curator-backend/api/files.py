"""Upload-first digital-copy routes: stage a PDF for a pending entity write.

A digital copy is a bridge node whose fields are machine-filled. The flow
(see ``.temp/temp-upload-first-files-*.md``):

1. ``POST /api/v1/curator/files/staged`` — parent-agnostic. Sniffs the PDF, computes
   sha256/size/pages, stores the bytes under ``staged/File_{8hex}.pdf`` and
   returns the prefilled ``schema:DigitalDocument`` node. The form shows it as a
   read-only bridge entry — on unsaved forms too.
2. ``GET /api/v1/curator/files/staged/{file_id}`` — preview of a file staged but not yet
   submitted. It lives here, not on the reader, because staged bytes are one
   curator's working state: nothing outside this service should hand them out.
   That is also why the staging response's ``contentUrl`` points here, and so
   resolves against the very origin the client just POSTed to.
3. The node travels inside the normal JSON-LD payload of ``POST /api/v1/curator/entities``
   under whatever predicate the *schema* declares (any shape with a property
   whose ``sh:node`` targets ``DigitalCopyShape`` gets the widget). The write
   path re-derives the metadata server-side — including ``contentUrl``, which it
   rewrites to the published path — and promotes the object to ``registered/``
   on persist. See ``api/data.py``.
4. ``GET /rdf/data/{file_id}/content`` streams a *published* copy back. That step is
   served by **dataexplorer-backend** — handing bytes out is a read. It refuses
   anything no parent entity references, which is why step 2 exists.

Abandoned staged files and unreferenced registered ones are collected by
``scripts/cleanup_files.py`` — RDF is the source of truth; storage is
reconciled against it, never the other way around. The read-only snapshot both
that script and ``/api/v1/dataexplorer/meta/files`` work from lives in
``rfdb_core.files_state``, since it is needed on both sides of the split.
