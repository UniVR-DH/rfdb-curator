"""FastAPI route handlers for the RossijskijFeatrDB data-entry API.

Every route that mutates the store is here, and only here. The read routes
(record listing, entity search, graph traversal, meta, digital-copy download)
moved to ``dataexplorer-backend/api/``.

All of it sits under ``/api/v1/curator/`` — a prefix that names its owner (D8), so
a request to the wrong service fails legibly and a read-only deployment simply
omits the namespace. Nothing here is published under ``/rdf/``: that space holds
permanent identifiers, and those should not resolve to the tier that mints them.
