"""Shape metadata routes used to build the sidebar nav and form schemas.

`GET /shapes` (mounted under the curator's API prefix) is called once at startup
by the React app to populate the shape list. `GET /forms` is called each time the
user selects a shape, to retrieve the ordered field definitions that drive form
generation — a writer-only route, since form fields exist to drive an editing form.

The shape list is **identical** to the reader's (D11): both build it through
:func:`rfdb_core.shapes.list_shapes`, so the `readOnly` flags cannot drift between
the two services. This module used to own the stamp, which is what made the editor
depend on the writer just to enumerate shapes (C20).
