"""Seed the triple store as a one-shot job, without starting a web server.

Same three steps the FastAPI lifespan runs — wait for the store, optionally wipe
it, load vocab (and optionally test data) — because it calls the same
``core.seeder.bootstrap_store()``. It exists so a deployment can separate
"populate the store" from "serve requests":

    docker compose run --rm curator-backend python scripts/seed.py

That matters for the read-only deploy mode in the modular-services plan, where
the stack runs dataexplorer-backend alone and no writer process is up to seed on
startup. Also useful for re-seeding after adding a vocabulary file, without
restarting the API.

Reads exactly the same environment variables as the service (``core.config``),
so a compose ``run`` inherits the right configuration by construction. Notably
``RESET_DATA_ON_STARTUP=true`` is honoured here too: this script will wipe the
store if the environment says to.

Idempotent: ``vocab.ttl`` merges rather than replaces, so re-running is safe.
Exits 0 on success, 1 with the reason on failure.
